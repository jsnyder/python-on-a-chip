Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates the use of PyMite on the
`AVR family`_ of microcontrollers.  Any AVR with at least 64 KiB of
program memory and 4 KiB of RAM can run PyMite.

.. _`AVR family`: http://www.atmel.com/products/AVR/

Details
-------

This sample project demonstrates a simple use case of PyMite on a
microcontroller.  The file ``sample.c`` is used to initialize PyMite
and indicate the name of the module it should run.  In this case, it
will run the module ``sample.py``

In the module ``sample.py``, we see that the program imports the ``avr`` module,
which is provided by PyMite.  An initialization function sets the port A data
direction register so that port A pins are all outputs.  A delay routine is
hardcoded to delay for one second.  We also see that the ``main()`` function
sets alternate pins high and low by writing value 0xAA to port A.


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean PyMite tree.  Edit the ``src/sample/avr/Makefile`` near
line 42 to set the type of AVR you are using and near line 43 to set the
frequency of your AVR's main clock.  The default values are::

    MCU = atmega103
    F_CPU = 4000000UL

Then build the PyMite archive with ``TARGET=AVR`` and this sample project.::

    $ make TARGET=AVR
    $ cd src/sample/avr
    $ make

This will result in the file ``src/sample/avr/sample.hex``.  Use your AVR
programmer of choice to program that file onto your target AVR device.

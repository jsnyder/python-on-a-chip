Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates the use of PyMite on the
`Arduino Mega`_ platform.

.. _`Arduino Mega`: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMega


Details
-------

This sample project demonstrates running the interactive prompt (ipm).
The file ``main.c`` is used to initialize the PyMite VM
and indicate the name of the module it should run.  In this case, it
will run the module ``main.py`` which prints "Hello World" and then runs
the interactive prompt.


Requirements
------------

The Arduino Mega has an FTDI USB-to-Serial device on-board.  You will need
to install `FTDI device drivers`_ for your operating system.

You also need to make sure you have PySerial_ installed so that Python 
can talk to your target device over the serial port::

    $ easy_install pyserial

.. _PySerial: http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/
.. _`FTDI device drivers`: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm


Building the Project
--------------------

From the project root directory::

    $ make PLATFORM=arduino_mega


Flashing the Binary
-------------------

The steps above result in the binary file that needs to go on the Arduino Mega.
The Arduino Mega should have the Arduino serial bootloader installed already.
This bootloader is compatible with the stk500v1 protocol so we will use
avrdude from within the makefile.  Edit the Makefile to set ``AVRDUDE_PORT``
to match your serial port or give the serial device path on the command line::

    $ cd src/platform/arduino_mega

    # Reset the Arduino Mega, and do the next line within 2 seconds

    $ make program AVRDUDE_PORT=/dev/tty.usbserial

If the program did not load onto the Arduino Mega, first check if you have a 
bootloader: press and release the reset button and watch the LED labeled "L"
on the opposite end of the FTDI chip from the USB plug.  If it does not flash, 
a bootloader is not present and one must be installed.  See instructions on 
`the Bootloader page`_ to install a bootloader.

The Arduino Bootloader waits about 2 seconds after reset to execute the binary.
So, while experimenting with ipm, be sure to give the board those two seconds
after reset before you issue commands.

Connect via ipm
---------------

Now, the Arduino Mega is running ipm and waiting for input from the host
computer.  So on your computer you need to run the host-side ipm
(the name of your serial device may vary)::

    $ ../../tools/ipm.py -f pmfeatures.py --serial /dev/tty.usbserial --baud=57600


Using ipm
---------

The following is an example session using ipm::
    
    ipm> import avr, sys
    ipm> avr.ddrA(0xff)
    ipm> avr.portA(0)       # Pins 22-29 all at 0 V
    ipm> avr.portA(0xa5)
    ipm> sys.heap()
    (2622, 7424)

After setting port A, the pin voltages are close to what you'd expect
(0xa5 = 0b10100101):

Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running interactive PyMite (ipm)
on the Atmel `AT91SAM7S-EK`_ which is an evaluation board for the 
`SAM7S family`_ of microcontrollers.  Any SAM7 with at least 
64 KiB of program memory and 8 KiB of RAM can run PyMite.

.. _`AT91SAM7S-EK`: http://atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3784
.. _`SAM7S family`: http://atmel.com/products/at91/default.asp


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean PyMite tree.  Build the PyMite VM archive as well as the 
sample application::

    $ cd src/platform/avr
    $ make


Flashing the Binary
-------------------

Use your ISP programming method of choice to program
``src/platform/at91sam7s-ek/main.hex`` onto your target AVR device.

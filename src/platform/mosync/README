===========================
The MoSync Platform Project

Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running a simple example in
MoSync_.  Since no obvious stdin exist on the platform unfortunately the
IPM is not an option yet.

.. _MoSync: http://www.mosync.com/


Building the Project
--------------------

- Start with a clean PyMite tree.
- Start the MoSync IDE.
- Create a new project: File -> New -> Project.
- In the Wizard choose: MoSync Project -> Choose a name -> MoSync C Project.
- Delete the main.c.
- Move the src/vm, src/lib and src/platform/mosync directories into the project.
  The easiest way is to move the entire src directory into the project directory,
  then delete ``tests/`` and everything in "``platform/`` except for mosync.
- Build the PyMite VM source archive as well as the sample application source::

    $ cd src/platform/mosync
    $ make

- The VM depends on the newlib library. Right click on Project -> Properties.
  MoSync Project -> Build Settings -> Paths and Files.
  Put "C:\MoSync\lib\newlib_release" (depending on the location of your MoSync
  installation) in Additional Library Paths. Put "newlib.lib" in Additional
  Libraries.
- Add the path to platform\mosync, vm and "C:\MoSync\include\newlib" to the
  Additional Include Paths, with comma (,) between.

- Check "Ignore Default" for all three options.

  Additional Include Paths:
    C:\MoSync\workspace\MoPyncR1\src\vm,C:\MoSync\workspace\MoPyncR1\src\platform\mosync,C:\MoSync\include\newlib
  Additional Library Paths:
    C:\MoSync\lib\newlib_release
  Additional Libraries:
    newlib.lib

- Right click on project -> Refresh.
- Build project in the MoSync IDE and run.

The program will show some moving rectangles. If you press a key or click on 
the screen, the events will be logged. 


Accessing the MoSync API
------------------------

The ma.py contains many of the maapi functions and definitions. So far almost 
all of the graphics and most of the basic events are supported. The ma_gen.py 
file contains some untested functions. If you miss a function a good start is 
to look in the ma_gen.py file, maybe there is something to build on there. 


Things to remember
------------------

Each time you make a change to the python source, you need to run make again. 
If you just rebuild from inside the IDE the old python program will be used. 

The print statement will print to the MoSync log. This is a great way to debug 
your code. 

The MoSync IDE can not edit python files, so you will need to use your 
favorite editor instead. 

If you need more memory for the pymite Python VM, increase the value of 
PM_HEAP_SIZE in the plat.h file. Don't forget to rebuild the MoSync project 
after that, only doing a build will not work. 

When using resources and .lst files, you need to handle all the resource ids 
manually. So far MAHeaders.py is not automatically created, since 
the MAHeaders.h is created as part of the IDE build. A future improvement 
would be to build everything from the command line.

PyMite Closures

Purpose
-------

This document describes the design and implementation of closures used in the
PyMite virtual machine (VM).  In doing so, it serves as a design document for
the PyMite developer and a reference for the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

Simply put, a closure_ allows you to define a function with "free" variables
that are not a part of the function's local scope, but instead reference
variables from a surrounding namespace.  The CPython implementation
introduced closures in version 2.2 via `PEP 227`_.  `Issue #256`_ implements
closures in the PyMite VM.  This implementation involves changes to the code
image structure as well has some internal VM structures and the addition of
four new bytecodes.

Details
-------

The following paragraphs describe how closures work in chronological order of
the lifetime of a program.

Source code containing a nested function with free variables is detected by
the CPython compiler.  A function containing variables referenced by nested
functions is given a tuple of strings that name the **cellvars**.  A nested
function with free variables is given a tuple of strings that name the
**freevars**.  The CPython compiler also uses the appropriate bytecodes
to manipulate freevars and cellvars.

When the resulting program is executed and the outer function is executed
via the ``CALL_FUNCTION`` bytecode, the VM copies variables from the function's
locals (including function arguments) into extra space in the frame designed
to hold the callvars.  This extra space is located between the local variables
and the stack in the frames "locals plus" field.  The ``LOAD_DEREF`` and
``STORE_DEREF`` bytecodes load and store stack references from/in cellvars.

The outer function then uses the ``LOAD_CLOSURE`` bytecodes to load cellvars
onto the stack where they are bundled into a tuple.  Then the ``MAKE_CLOSURE``
bytecode builds a function from the code object on the stack and gives the
function a reference to the tuple of cellvars, thus creating a closure.
The outer function may finish executing and its frame may be destroyed,
but the references to the closure variables is maintained by the closure tuple.

Later in the program when the inner function (the closure) is called, the
``CALL_FUNCTION`` bytecode detects that the function is a closure and copies
the object references from the tuple into the function's new frame's
freevars (which is also located after the local variables and before the stack).


Design Decisions
----------------

The PyMite VM always tries to find smaller ways of implementing Python.
As such, the following paragraphs explain some changes to the way CPython
implements closures.

The first hurdle to overcome is that the **cellvars** and **freevars** tuples
of strings would greatly increase the size of the code images.  So, instead
of doing variable lookup by name, variable lookup is done by index.
When the ``pmImgCreator.py`` script processes Python source code to turn it
into an image, the **cellvars** tuple of strings is turned into a tuple of
integers.  Those integers let the ``CALL_FUNCTION`` bytecode know where to
find the variable to copy into the cellvar.

The **freevars** tuple is a different matter.  It turns out, the strings in
the freevars tuple aren't necessary, only the number of freevars is needed
by ``CALL_FUNCTION`` to know how many closures to copy from the closure tuple.
So, instead of a **freevars** tuple, the code image has a **nfreevars** byte
to indicate the number of freevars.

The other way to reduce memory consuption was to eliminate the extra "cell"
datatype that CPython uses to hold a reference to an object.  The design of
the PyMite VM just did not require such a container for the reference.  Instead,
regular object references are used.  This has the additional beneficial side
effect of making the ``LOAD_CLOSURE`` and ``LOAD_DEREF`` bytecode
implementations identical (saving code space).

The result of the above changes is an implementation of statically nested
functions with the ability to reference variables that are in the scope
of the enclosing namespace.  The resulting ability to make closures creates
a powerful tool for the programmer.


Example Use
-----------

The following Python source code demonstrates the utility of a closure.
In this example, we imagine that the programmer wants to define a function
that is called as a callback function by the system.  In this imaginary example,
the ``callback_table`` holds a reference to all the callback functions.

::

    callback_table = {}
    HOOK_ADC = 1003

    def setHook(event):
        def _sh(f):
            callback_table[event] = f
            return f
        return _sh

    @setHook(HOOK_ADC)
    def onAdcReady():
        pass

The setHook function accepts an event argument which tells in what slot the
callback function should be stored.  Inside setHook we se a nested function,
_sh, which stores the function in the callback table and returns the function.
This lets setHook behave as a decorator.  The last three lines show setHook
being used as a decorator with a parameter and the definition of the callback
function.  In this example, the body is empty; the programmer may replace the
pass statement with whatever code he needs to process the results of an
analog-to-digital conversion.

In the code example above, setHook has one cellvar named event and _sh has one
freevar named event.

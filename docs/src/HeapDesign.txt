======================
The PyMite Heap Design
======================

:Author:    Dean Hall
:Id:        $Id$


Purpose
-------

This document describes the design of the memory heap for the PyMite project.
In doing so, it serves as a design document for the PyMite developers.


Overview
--------

PyMite shall use a contiguous block of RAM for the virtual machine's
memory heap.  All of PyMite's dynamic memory comes from the heap.  An API
shall be provided to allocate and free chunks and perform other operations
with the heap.  The heap's internal implementation shall be transparent
to the user.  A mark-sweep garbage collector is used to reclaim allocated
chunks that are no longer in use by the VM.


Design
------

PyMite uses a statically declared, contiguous block of RAM as the memory heap
to avoid using memory allocation functions such as ``malloc()`` which vary
from one embedded target library to another.

Memory from the heap is rendered to the caller in chunks.  A chunk is simply
a contiguous block of memory with an object descriptor at the top of the chunk.
The object descriptor contains information about the chunk that is used by the
heap as well as the PyMite virtual machine.  When the caller requests a chunk
of a certain size, the heap adds extra space to the chunk to allow for the
object descriptor.  A chunk has minimum and maximum size limits.  The minimum
chunk size is equivalent to the size of the heap descriptor type.  Since the
size of a heap descriptor varies with the target device, the value for the
minimum chunk size is platform depedent.  The size field in the object
descriptor indicates the size of the chunk, but not directly.  That means,
a value of 0x10 in the size field does not necessarily mean the chunk is 16
bytes in size.  The actual meaning of the size field depends on the
implementation.

The PyMite VM uses dynamic memory from the heap during operation to hold
objects.  The VM must keep a reference to a chunk for it to be able to use
the object in that chunk.  When the VM no longer needs an object it may
explicitly free the chunk containing the object or it may simply erase the
reference to the object.  In the latter case, the garbage collector
is responsible for finding and reclaiming objects that are no longer in use.
A reclaimed chunk can be overwritten an re-used for future chunk requests.

Interface
---------

The public API, ``heap_getChunk()``, shall be provided to allocate a chunk of
memory from the heap.  This API will return an error code in its return value
if a suitable chunk cannot be provided or some other error occurs.  If the
return value indicates succes, a pointer to a chunk of memory is returned by
reference.  This chunk shall have its size field set and its size shall be the
requested size or larger.  Some 32-bit target devices require addresses of
items to be even multiples of four bytes.  So the implementation of
``heap_getChunk()`` rounds up the requested chunk size to the next even multiple
of four.  This results in a small amout of wasted memory (internal
fragmentation).

The public API, ``heap_freeChunk()``, shall be provided to return a chunk of
memory to the heap.  This API will return an error code in its return value
if an error occurs.  At this time, there are no known ways an error can occur.
This API should only be used if the chunk being returned is known, for certain,
to no longer be in use by the VM.  If it is not known whether a chunk is in
use or not, the programmer should do nothing and allow the garbage collector
to reclaim unused chunks.

The garbage collector is activated automatically when, chunk allocation fails
inside ``heap_getChunk()``.  The garbage collector reclaims chunks that are
no longer being used by the VM and makes them available for allocation.
Inside ``heap_getChunk()`` a second attempt to allocate a chunk is made after
garbage collection is complete.  If this second attempt fails, an OutOfMemory
exception is raised; otherwise, the newly allocated chunk is returned by
reference.


Implementation
--------------

This paragraph explains the memory allocation policy used by the heap.
The allocator shall use a Best-Fit algorithm to allocate chunks from the heap.
The Best-Fit algorithm is chosen because research shows that when it is
combined with coalescing reclamation, fragmentation is reduced to
insignificance [Johnstone1998]_.  Furthermore, Best-Fit is chosen because
the cost of scanning the free list of PyMite's small heap is bounded.

After the heap is initialized, all available memory is in one big chunk
in the free list.  However, after the VM operates for some time, the free list
contains multiple free chunks.  These chunks shall be kept in a doubly-linked
list ordered by their size, from small to large.
If a best fit chunk is not available, an exact fit chunk is carved from the
largest chunk.

Chunks are added to the free list by an explicit call to ``heap_freeChunk()``
or during the sweep phase of the garbage collector.  When a chunk is added to
the free list by ``heap_freeChunk()``, it is not coalesced with neighboring
chunks even if they are not in use.  Instead, the chunk is just inserted into
the free list.  That chunk will be coalesced the next time the garbage collector
runs.  This method of lazy coalescing leaves the chunk in the free list
which allows an opportunity for the chunk to be re-used without the cost
of coalescing and splitting.  Garbage collection occurs when no chunks of
suitable size are available, which is an appropriate time to perform coalescing.

Heap Chunk Duality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A memory chunk can take two forms throughout the execution of the PyMite VM.
When a chunk is allocated and in use, it uses the object descriptor struct,
``PmObjDesc_t``, to store important operational details.  This is accomplished
by declaring ``PmObjDesc_t`` at the head of every PyMite object structure.
However, when that same chunk is deallocated and in the free list, it uses
the heap descriptor struct, ``PmHeapDesc_t``, so that a larger value can be
stored in the size field.  When a chunk is not in use, the type field and GC
mark bit are no longer needed and are not present in the heap descriptor.
The ``PmHeapDesc_t`` structure also has one or more pointers used to create
the free list.


The Object Descriptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Care is taken to keep the object descriptor as small as possible.  PyMite's
object descriptor uses only two bytes.  The object desriptor has four fields:
the size field (9 bits), the GC mark bit, the free bit and the object type
(5-bits) field.

The size field connotes the size of the chunk.  The size field is multiplied
by four to get the actual size of the chunk.  The GC mark bit is used by the
mark-sweep garbage collector.  The free bit indicates to the garbage
collector's sweep phase when an object is free and available to be coalesced.
The free bit is not strictly necessary, but having it eliminates the need to
change the GC mark bit of all objects in the free list during garbage collection.
The type field is used by the PyMite VM to denote the type of object in this
chunk.

The following is a diagram of the object descriptor at the head of a chunk::

           MSb          LSb
           7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
 pchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+     S := od_size: Size of the chunk (2 LSbs dropped)
          |     S[9:2]    |     F := od_free: free bit
          +-+-+---------+-+     M := od_gcval: GC Mark bit
          |F|M|    T    |S|     T := od_type: Object type (language specific)
          +-+-+---------+-+
          | object data   |
          ...           ...
          | end data      |     Theoretical min size == 2
          +---------------+     Effective min size == 8


This paragraph explains what happens when a chunk is allocated.  A chunk is
allocated with a requested size, that size is bumped up to the
next multiple of four to accomodate 4-byte alignment on some 32-bit platforms.
The chunk's size field is set to the effective size (divided by 4).
The free bit is cleared so that the GC knows this chunk is in use during the
sweep phase.  The GC mark bit is set to the current GC mark, so the object
doesn't accidently survive the next garbage collection cycle.
The type field is left alone (the caller will set the object type).
If this chunk is carved from the front of a larger chunk, the remainder
chunk's heap descriptor must be created: the size field is set to the reduced
size and the free bit is set.


The Heap Descriptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the heap descriptor is used in chunks that are not active and do not use
the contents of the chunk, the heap descriptor is larger than the object
descriptor.  PyMite's heap descriptor uses two bytes and two pointers.  Since
pointer sizes vary on 8, 16 and 32-bit platforms, the size of the heap
descriptor is platform dependent.  The heap desriptor has two fields:
the size field (14 bits) and the free bit.  One bit is reserved for future
use.

The size field connotes the size of the chunk.  The size field is multiplied
by four to get the actual size of the chunk.  Since chunks that are not in use
may be as large as the entire heap, the size field is made larger than the one
in the object descriptor.  However, the same trick of not storing the two LSbs
is used.  Instead of having a GC mark bit, the heap descriptor uses the free
bit to tell the GC that this chunk is not in use.  This means all chunks in the
free list do not need to be marked during the mark phase of the GC.
The free bit indicates to the garbage collector's sweep phase when an object
is free and available to be coalesced.

The heap descriptor also contains two pointers, prev and next.  These pointers
are used to form the doubly-linked list of free chunks.

The following is a diagram of the heap descriptor at the head of a chunk::

           MSb          LSb
           7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
 pchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
          |     S[9:2]    |     S := hd_size: Size of the chunk (2 LSbs dropped)
          +-+-+-----------+     F := hd_free: free bit
          |F|R| S[15:10]  |     R := hd_reserved: Bit reserved for future use
          +-+-+-----------+
          |     P(L)      |     P := hd_prev: Pointer to previous node
          |     P(H)      |     N := hd_next: Pointer to next node
          |     N(L)      |
          |     N(H)      |     Theoretical min size == 6
          +---------------+     Effective min size == 8 (12 on 32-bit MCUs)
          | unused space  |
          ...           ...
          | end chunk     |
          +---------------+


This paragraph explains what happens when a chunk is deallocated.  A chunk is
deallocated in one of two ways.  A chunk can be explicitly deallocated by a
call to ``heap_freeChunk()``.  In this case, the chunk's free bit is set
and the chunk is inserted into the free list without being coalesced.  The chunk
may be coalesced later during the sweep phase of garbage collection.  The
heaps's available size is updated to include the free chunk.

A chunk may also be implicitly deallocated by the garbage collector.  If a
chunk is not reachable from the roots list during a GC cycle, that chunk is no
longer being actively used by the VM and is deallocated.  In this case, the
chunk's free bit is set and the chunk is possibly coalesced with free
neighbor chunks during the sweep phase of the GC.  The coalesced chunk is
inserted into the free list.  The heaps's available size is updated to include
the free chunk.


Garbage Collection
------------------

Garbage collection is the process of reclaiming memory chunks that are no longer
in use by the virtual machine.  PyMite uses a mark-sweep style garbage
collector as opposed to a reference counting collector so that the programmer
does not have to manually account for object use in native code.

The garbage collector is activated when a request for a memory chunk is made
and cannot be fulfilled because no chunk of suitable size is available.
When the garbage collector is activated, the activity in the PyMite virtual
machine stops.  Garbage collection begins with the mark phase of the mark-
sweep collector.  The heap toggles a global bit that is used to represent the
"marked" state.  Then, starting from the known root objects, the garbage
collector recursively marks all objects that are reachable.  Remaining objects
that were not marked now have a stale value in their object descriptor's GC mark
field.  After all reachable objects are marked, the sweep phase of the collector
begins.

The sweep phase of the garbage collector starts at the base of the heap and
proceeds sequentially through memory.  Each object that is free or whose GC
mark field is stale is reclaimed.  Neighboring free chunks are coalesced into
a single larger chunk.  Reclaimed chunks are inserted into the free list.
Coalesced chunks, because their size has changed, must be removed and
reinserted in the free list in order to maintain sorted order.
A doubly linked list is used to make list removal and insertion easier.

A special case arises when the GC activates when the interpreter is executing 
native code.  In this case, newly-allocated objects could be collected because 
they have not yet linked to their final object which would make it reachable 
from the roots list.  To prevent this from happening, objects that are 
allocated in a native code session are given a GC mark value that will
allow that object to survive the next run of the GC.  Furthermore, the GC uses
a counter variable in the native frame to prevent the GC from running twice
while in one native code session.  These two implementation-specific features
combine to prevent objects allocated in native code from being collected should
the GC run later during that same native session.  If the case arises that the
GC activates twice during one native code session, an out of memory exception
is raised.


Conclusion
----------

PyMite includes its own dynamic memory allocation system that is based on a
static block of RAM called the heap.  The heap allocates and reclaims chunks
of memory to and from the PyMite VM during runtime.  Memory chunks are
constrained in size and can be explicitly freed when no longer needed.
Garbage collection is performed when needed.  The garbage collector coalesces
neighboring chunks that, when combined with the Best-Fit allocator policy
reduces fragmentation in the heap.

===================
PyMite Class Design
===================

:Author:    Dean Hall

Purpose
-------

This document describes the PyMite virtual machine (VM) support for classes.
In doing so, it serves as a design document for the PyMite developer.


Overview
--------

The PyMite VM has the simplest possible implementation of classes that allows
it to operate without changing the output from the Python compiler.  
What this means is that the PyMite programmer will write code to create classes
just as he would for Python.  The code will be run through pmImgCreator.py
just like all other PyMite code.


Python Classes Walk-through
---------------------------

This section discusses the design of PyMite classes by reverse-engineering
Python classes, leaving out irrelevant details and honing the simplest solution.
The study of classes begins by disassembling the following code::

    class Foo(object):
        a=42
        def bar(self,):
            pass

    foo = Foo()
    foo.bar()

Use ``src/tools/dismantle.py`` to disassemble the code above.  The rest of
this discussion will study snippets of the output from dismantle.
The first thing to observe is that compiling the code above results in
three code objects: the module, the class ``Foo`` and the function ``bar``
(``bar`` is not a method yet).

Examining the bytecode of the module's code object, we see that it builds
the class ``Foo``, creates the instance ``foo`` and then calls the method
``bar`` and discards the result.  Here is the bytecode that builds the class::

     0 LOAD_CONST               0 ('Foo')
     3 LOAD_NAME                0 (object)
     6 BUILD_TUPLE              1
     9 LOAD_CONST               1 (<code object Foo at 0x779b0, file "t202.py", line 13>)
    12 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
    15 CALL_FUNCTION            0
    18 BUILD_CLASS         
    19 STORE_NAME               1 (Foo)

As of PyMite release 08, every bytecode in the listing above is supported
with the exception of ``BUILD_CLASS``.  By studying the bytecode above
and also looking inside the `CPython implementation`_ of the ``BUILD_CLASS`` 
bytecode, we see that ``BUILD_CLASS`` takes three items from the stack:

1. locals dict from executing Foo() as a function.  Its contents are:
   ``{"__module__" : "__name__", a : 42, bar : <function>}``
2. tuple: (object,)
3. string: "Foo"

This will be a good place to implement the function
``class_new(attrs, bases, name, r_pobj)`` and make a call to it.

.. _`CPython implementation`: http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Python/ceval.c?view=markup

The next block of the disassembly seems redundant, but there's a subtle
difference::
    
    22 LOAD_NAME                1 (Foo)
    25 CALL_FUNCTION            0
    28 STORE_NAME               2 (foo)

Didn't we just execute ``Foo`` in the previous block?  Yes, but it was a *code*
object back then.  In this block, ``Foo`` is the *class* object that was created 
by ``BUILD_CLASS``.   This code is responsible for creating an instance of 
class ``Foo``.  Which means the ``CALL_FUNCTION`` bytecode implementation 
is going to need a special case to:

1. detect when the called item is a class
2. create an instance of the class
3. create the method from ``__init__()`` if it exists and run it

That's a lot to do, so the helper function, ``class_instatiate(class, r_pobj)``
will be created.

The final block of code is where a little bit of magic happens::
    
    31 LOAD_NAME                2 (foo)
    34 LOAD_ATTR                3 (bar)
    37 CALL_FUNCTION            0
    40 POP_TOP             
    41 LOAD_CONST               2 (None)
    44 RETURN_VALUE        
    
At this point ``foo`` is an instance, but it does not have any attributes,
methods, nada.  The bytecode ``LOAD_ATTR`` needs a special case to look into
an instance's parental tree to find the attribute ``bar``.  If ``bar`` is
a function, then a method needs to be created from the function.  The structure
used to represent a method contains three important things: the instance 
which becomes the "*self*" parameter later on, the function and the class.

Next, the ``CALL_FUNCTION`` bytecode implementation will need a special case
to detect a method and insert the instance object as the "*self*" parameter
on the stack before calling the instance's function.


A Little Bit of Efficiency
--------------------------

In the section above, I mentioned two special cases that needed to be added
to the implementation of the bytecode ``CALL_FUNCTION``.  One to detect
a class and create an instance; another to detect a method and call its
function.  While implementing these two special cases, I discovered that 
by ordering them appropriately, one case naturally followed the other.

The first case creates an instance of a class and, if the ``__init__``
function exists, must call it as a method.  The second case detects a method,
does the all-important insertion of the ``self`` parameter and calls the
function.  So, by adding the proper logic, these two special cases naturally
coexist even when methods other than ``__init__()`` are called.


Design Decisions
----------------

In a Python class, the instance intializer function is named 
``__init__(self,...)``.  In PyMite, it would be possible to allow a differently 
named function to serve as the initializer, such as one with a shorter name 
that would conserve memory.  However, the name should be kept ``__init__`` 
so that the same source code can run properly in CPython.

At this point, all the meta-classes and meta-methods are not going to be part
of the design.  This is to keep the design simple and small.

How to Release PyMite
=====================

:Author:    Dean Hall

Purpose
-------

This document describes how to make a package release of the PyMite project.
In doing so, it is intended strictly for the PyMite release manager.

Overview
--------

Creating a release of PyMite involves updating information in a number of places
and performing some housekeeping actions, but it is a fairly straightforward
process that can be accomplished by performing the following list of actions
in the prescribed order:

    - Create a ticket in the issue tracking system

        - Give the ticket a title like "Create release 03"
        - Assign the ticket to the proper milestone
        - Accept the ticket

    - Create a branch for the issue (there will be changes to files)
    - Edit the ``README`` file:

        - Update the ":Release:" number near the top of the file
        - Add thanks to anyone who gave helpful feedback
        - In the "Release Notes" section, create a new entry for the release
        - Add a line item into the entry for each significant new feature or fix

    - Edit ``src/vm/pm.h``, update the value for the definition, ``PM_RELEASE``
    - Run GNU indent on src/vm using the command ``make indent``
    - Perform all the standard builds to see that they complete without error

        - ``make html``
        - ``make TAGS``
        - ``make check``
        - ``make ipm``
        - ``map(range, range(5))``
        - ``Ctrl+D``
        - ``make PLATFORM=at91sam7s-ek``
        - ``make PLATFORM=avr``
        - ``cd src/platform/at91sam7s-ek; arm-elf-size main.elf``
        - ``cd ../avr; avr-size main.elf``

    - Record the sizes of main.elf for at91sam7s-ek and avr in the ticket
    - Verify that a sample app runs on as many platforms as available
    - Check-in the branch and review
    - Mainline the branch
    - Tag the release in the repository and make the distribution file::

        $ make dist PM_RELEASE=RR

    - Upload the distribution file to the `Python-on-a-chip downloads`_ page
    - Announce the release on:

        - The Python-on-a-chip_ Project front page
        - The `Python-on-a-chip maillist`_
        - `comp.lang.python.announce`_

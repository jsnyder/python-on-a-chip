How to Release PyMite
=====================

:Author:    Dean Hall

Purpose
-------

This document describes how to make a package release of the PyMite project.
In doing so, it is intended strictly for the PyMite release manager.

Overview
--------

Creating a release of PyMite involves updating information in a number of places
and performing some housekeeping actions, but it is a fairly straightforward
process that can be accomplished by performing the following list of actions
in the prescribed order:

    - Create a ticket in the issue tracking system

        - Give the ticket a title like "Create release 03"
        - Assign the ticket to the proper milestone
        - Accept the ticket

    - Create a branch for the issue (there will be changes to files)
    - Edit the ``README`` file:

        - Update the ":Release:" number near the top of the file
        - Add thanks to anyone who gave helpful feedback
        - In the "Release Notes" section, create a new entry for the release
        - Add a line item into the entry for each ticket that went into this
          release.

    - Edit ``src/vm/pm.h``, update the value for the definition, ``PM_RELEASE``
    - Run GNU indent on src/vm using the command ``make indent``
    - Perform all the standard builds to see that they complete without error

        - ``make html``
        - ``make TAGS``
        - ``make check``
        - ``make ipm``
        - ``map(range, range(5))``
        - ``Ctrl+D``
        - ``make PLATFORM=at91sam7s-ek``
        - ``make PLATFORM=avr``
        - ``cd src/platform/avr; avr-size main.elf``
        - Record the size of the AVR sample app in the ticket

    - Verify that a sample app runs on an AVR device; this can be done in
      one of the following ways:

        - Download and run a known good app on an actual AVR device
        - Build and run a known good app in Atmel's AvrStudio simulator
        - Run a known good app on an AVR simulator

    - Verify that a sample app runs on an AT91SAM7 device; this can be done in
      one of the following ways:

        - Download and run a known good app on an actual AT91SAM7 device

            - ``cd src/platform/at91sam7s-ek; make``
            - Connect the AT91SAM7S-EK to the computer via a USB cable
            - Apply a jumper to JP5 for 10 seconds to restore SAM-BA; remove
              the jumper
            - Disconnect, pause and reconnect the AT91SAM7S-EK's USB cable
              to reset the connection
            - Run ``sam7``::

                % sam7
                found boot agent
                Chip Version: 0
                Embedded Processor: ARM7TDMI
                NVRAM Region 1 Size: 64 K
                NVRAM Region 2 Size: 0 K
                SRAM Size: 16 K
                Series: AT91SAM7Sxx
                Page Size: 128 bytes
                Lock Regions: 16

                sam7> unlock_regions
                unlocking region 0: done
                unlocking region 1: done

                sam7> flash sample.bin
                sam7> boot_from_flash
                sam7> <ctrl+c>

        - Build and run a known good app in IAR's Embedded Workbench for Arm,
          Kickstart edition
        - Run a known good app on an ARM simulator

    - Check-in the branch and review
    - Mainline the branch
    - Tag the mainline::

        $ svn cp -m "issue #nn Creating release RR" https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/tags/pymite-RR
        
    - Make the distribution file::

        $ make dist PM_RELEASE=RR

    - Upload the tar.gz file to the `Python-on-a-chip downloads`_ page.

    - Announce the release on:

        - The Python-on-a-chip_ Project front page
        - The `Python-on-a-chip maillist`_
        - `comp.lang.python.announce`_

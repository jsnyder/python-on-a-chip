How to Program the Atmel AT91SAM7S64-EK
=======================================

:Author:    Dean Hall
:Id:        $Id$

Purpose
-------

This document describes how to connect a host computer to the Atmel
AT91SAM7S64-EK evaluation board in order to program the device's memory.
In doing so, it serves as a technical guide to the developer and user.

Overview
--------

One of PyMite's supported targets is the ARM7 core and the Atmel AT91SAM7
family in particular.  The author supports this target because he has a
AT91SAM7S64-EK evaluation board.  This document describes how to load a
PyMite program onto this target.


Requirements
------------

The developer needs a host computer with a USB port and a recent copy of
Subversion_ SCM.

The developer shall download the sam7utils_ open source software::

    svn co https://oss.tekno.us/svn/sam7utils/trunk sam7utils

The developer shall build same7utils for his host computer::

    cd sam7utils
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

.. _sam7utils: http://oss.tekno.us/sam7utils/
.. _Subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/


Preparing the Device
--------------------

The AT91SAM7S64-EK needs to have its bootloader restored in order to flash
a new program.

To restore the bootloader (SAM-BA):

    - Apply a jumper to JP5 for 15 seconds to restore SAM-BA; remove
      the jumper
    - Disconnect, pause and reconnect the AT91SAM7S-EK's USB cable
      to reset the connection


Loading the PyMite Program
--------------------------

The sam7utils are used to load the PyMite sample program onto the
AT91SAM7S64-EK.  Run the following commands at a command prompt::

    % sam7
    found boot agent
    Chip Version: 0
    Embedded Processor: ARM7TDMI
    NVRAM Region 1 Size: 64 K
    NVRAM Region 2 Size: 0 K
    SRAM Size: 16 K
    Series: AT91SAM7Sxx
    Page Size: 128 bytes
    Lock Regions: 16

    sam7> unlock_regions
    unlocking region 0: done
    unlocking region 1: done

    sam7> flash sample.bin
    sam7> boot_from_flash
    sam7> <ctrl+c>

Troubleshooting
---------------

If ``sam7`` is run and it reports, "can not find boot agent",
then retry the steps in `Preparing the Device`_ with longer jumper application
times.

=======================
PyMite Generator Design
=======================
Supporting the keyword yield
============================


:Author:    Dean Hall
:Id:        $Id$


Purpose
-------

This document describes the PyMite virtual machine (VM) support for the
yield keyword's use to create generators.
In doing so, it serves as a design document for the PyMite developer.


Overview
--------

The PyMite VM shall support the three forms of generators: iterator functions,
generator expressions and coroutines.
Background information on simple generators in Python is found in `PEP 255`_
while coroutines via enhanced generators is found in `PEP 342`_.
Generators in PyMite follow the designs in these PEPs, but may not implement
them in their entirety.  Furthermore, the implementation of generators in PyMite
is done by reverse engineering output from the Python compiler.
What this means is that the PyMite programmer will write code to create a
generator just as he would for Python.  The code will be run through
pmImgCreator.py, which uses Python's compiler, just like all other PyMite code.

Python Generator-iterators Walk-through
---------------------------------------

This section discusses the design of PyMite generator-iterators by
reverse-engineering Python, leaving out irrelevant details and honing the
simplest solution. The study of iterators begins by disassembling the following
code, an infinite iterator that generates the Fibonacci sequence and a simple
for loop that requests values from the iterator::

    def fib():
        a, b = 0, 1
        while True:
            yield a
            a, b = b, a+b

    for i in fib():
        print i,
        if i > 256:
            break

Use ``src/tools/dismantle.py`` to disassemble the code above.  The rest of
this discussion will study snippets of the output from dismantle.
The first thing to observe is that compiling the code above results in
two code objects: the module and the function ``fib``.

Examining the bytecode of the module's code object, we see that it builds
the function ``fib`` just as it would any other function.  ``fib`` becomes
a generator-iterator function.  Below is the bytecode that shows how the
generator-iterator function is used::

 24           9 SETUP_LOOP              39 (to 51)
             12 LOAD_NAME                0 (fib)
             15 CALL_FUNCTION            0
             18 GET_ITER
        >>   19 FOR_ITER                28 (to 50)
             22 STORE_NAME               1 (i)

As of PyMite release 08, every bytecode in the listing above is supported.
However, the ``CALL_FUNCTION`` bytecode needs to be changed to detect when
the function is a generator and to create a generator instance as needed.
This is done by inspecting a flag that is set in the code object by
the compiler.  The generator is going to be an instance of a new Generator
class that is declared in PyMite's buildins, src/lib/__bi.py.
Next, the ``GET_ITER`` bytecode needs  to be changed
to ignore the top-of-stack when it is a generator.  The ``FOR_ITER`` bytecode
then needs to detect a generator object and call its next method.
The next method is responsible for executing the generator
function until it yields a result.  The yielded result is put on the stack
and used by the next bytecode, STORE_NAME.

Inside the function ``fib``, the only new thing is the yield statement that
results in the following bytecode::

 21          22 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
             25 YIELD_VALUE
             26 POP_TOP

The ``YIELD_VALUE`` bytecode needs to be implemented.  It is resposible
for placing the item on this function's top-of-stack on the caller's
top-of-stack, where "the caller" is whomever called the generator's ``next()``
or ``send()`` method.  This differs from ``RETURN_VALUE`` in that the
generator's function is not disposed of; it is kept in the generator instance
so it can be called again, resuming execution one instruction after
``YIELD_VALUE``.


Generator Expressions
---------------------

A generator expression is an expression that looks like a list-comprehension
wrapped in parentheses rather than brackets.  The following is an example
generator expression::

    b = (2*x for x in a)

The Python compiler creates the following bytecode for the generator
expression::

 24          18 LOAD_CONST               4 (<code object <genexpr> at 0x75a...>)
             21 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
             24 LOAD_NAME                0 (a)
             27 GET_ITER
             28 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             31 STORE_NAME               1 (b)

This disassembly reveals the the Python compiler turned the generator expression
into an anonymous generator function.  So, the behavior of a generator
expression is identical to a generator function and no extra changes to the VM
are necessary to support generator expressions.


Generator Coroutines
--------------------

A generator coroutine is created by defining a function and using a yield
expression inside the function.  The yield expression can accept an argument
as well as return a value.  A demonstration coroutine and how to use
it is seen below (line numbers are added for discussion)::

    0 def coro(n):
    1     outgoing = 0
    2     while True:
    3         incoming = (yield outgoing)
    4         print "I shall print the incoming message", n, "times:", incoming * n
    5         outgoing += 1
    6
    7 c3 = coro(3)
    8 print "Priming coro:", c3.next()
    9 print "Sending 'moo':", c3.send("moo")

Inside the function, the line with the yield expression, line 3, is the only
thing special in the source code.  However, because it is a coroutine (and not
a function) it is used in a special manner.  Line 7 shows that ``coro()`` is
called with an argument and its output is stored in ``c3``.  But because it is
a coroutine, it returns a generator object, so ``c3`` is an instance of class
``Generator``.  It is important to note that the call to ``coro()`` did not
execute any code inside the coroutine, it simply created an instance of
coroutine and an execution frame which will be used to run the code and
save execution state later on.  The first call to a coroutine must be the
``next()`` method.  The first call to ``next()`` executes the code inside the
coroutine from the start to the first yield statement.  Now, the coroutine
is ready to accept input via the ``send()`` method.

Despite the long-winded explanation, there is very little about
generator-coroutines that differs from generator-iterators.  The one difference
is that arguments can now be sent to the generator via the ``send()`` method.
This is done by a simple stack push operation.

One issue not encountered in the example code above is what happens when a 
coroutine returns.  According to PEP 342, a GeneratorExit exception should
be raised.  So a special case is added to ``RETURN_VALUE`` to detect when
returning from a coroutine.  PyMite does not support exceptions at the time
of this writing, so instead of raising the exception, an attempt is made to
jump to a handler in the block stack.  If no handler is found, the VM exits
with an error.  This behavior is not ideal, but it works compactly for now.
A change to this behavior may be needed in the future.


Design Decisions
----------------

PEP 342 states that a generator object has these methods: ``__init__, next, send,
throw, close`` and ``__del__``.  This implementation supports the first three 
methods, but not the latter three.  Methods ``throw`` and ``close`` make use
of the ability to catch exceptions which is not yet supported in PyMite.
And ``__del__`` requires the ability to run code during a garbage collection
which is not support by the current infrastructure.  The author decided to
go ahead with this incomplete implementation since it supports the most common
uses of generators and will provide a great new feature with a small increase
in code size.  Completing the implementation may performed in the future.

PyMite Features
===============


:Author:    Dean Hall
:Id:        $Id$


Purpose
-------

This document describes the features of the Python language that
are supported by PyMite.  In doing so, it serves as a guide to the user.


Overview
--------

PyMite is targeted toward 8-bit microcontrollers with limited program and
random access memories.  In order to operate in this embedded environment,
PyMite had to sacrifice many features found in desktop Python.
This document attempts to itemize the features found in PyMite in order
to convey to the user what is possible when using this programming environment.


Invocation Options and Environment Variables
--------------------------------------------

Small embedded systems rarely have consoles or an operating system or a
desktop-style shell-like interface.  Usually, the application is executed
directly when the target device is powered up or reset.  For these reasons,
PyMite DOES NOT have any invocation options or observe any environment
variables.


Lexical Entities
----------------

Keywords
~~~~~~~~

PyMite supports the following subset of Python's keywords::

    and         assert      break       continue    def
    del         elif        else        for         from
    global      if          import      in          is
    lambda      not         or          pass        print
    raise       return      while

PyMite DOES NOT support these keywords::

    class       except      exec        finally     try         yield

Identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMite observes the same rules as Python for identifiers::

    (letter | "_") (letter | digit | "_")*

However, NO special actions (or inactions) are taken for identifiers
with the special forms: `_ident`, `__ident__` and `__ident`.
.. ` This is just to fix the colorizer

String Literals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMite supports 8-bits per character strings, BUT NOT Unicode.
Forms a string literal can take::

    "a string enclosed by double quotes"
    'another string delimited by single quotes and with a " inside'
    '''a string containing embedded newlines and quote (') marks, can be
    delimited with triple quotes.'''
    """ may also use 3- double quotes as delimiters """
    r'a raw string where \ are kept literal: handy for regular expressions and windows paths!'
    R"another raw string"   -- raw strings cannot end with a \

All string literal escape forms are supported except those that describe
a Unicode character.

=============== ============================================================
Escape          Meaning
=============== ============================================================
\\newline       Ignored (escape newline)
\\ \\           Backslash (\\)
\\e             Escape (ESC)
\\v             Vertical Tab (VT)
\\'             Single quote (')
\\f             Formfeed (FF)
\\0oo           Char with octal value oo
\\"             Double quote (")
\\n             Linefeed (LF)
\\a             Bell (BEL)
\\r             Carriage Return (CR)
\\xhh           Char with hex value hh
\\b             Backspace (BS)
\\t             Horizontal Tab (TAB)
\\AnyOtherChar  Left as-is, including the backslash, e.g. str('\z') == '\\z'
=============== ============================================================

Boolean Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMite supports the ``bool`` datatype and the boolean constants, ``True`` and
``False``.  When used as a subscript (such as ``seq[bool]``), a ``False`` bool
is equivalent to an integer 0; and a ``True`` bool is equivalent to 1.

Numbers
~~~~~~~

PyMite supports the typical 32-bit signed integer number type.
A number can be input in any of the following forms:

- Decimal integer: 1234,
- Octal integer: 0177 (begins with a 0)
- Hex integer: 0xFF (begins with 0x or 0X)

PyMite must be configured to support Floating Point numbers.
By default, PyMite does not enable this support.
See the ``HAVE_FLOAT`` definition in ``src/vm/pmfeatures.h`` to enable support.

PyMite DOES NOT support Long or Complex numbers.

Sequences
~~~~~~~~~

PyMite supports String, Tuple and List sequence types

    - String (type str; max length 999 chars)
      '', '1', "12", 'hello\n'
    - Tuple (type tuple; max length 253)
      () (1,) (1,2) # parentheses are optional if len > 0
    - List (type list; max length 32767)
      [] [1] [1,2]

- Indexing is 0-based. Negative indices (usually) mean count backwards from end
  of sequence.
- Sequence slicing is NOT fully supported.  Only the sequence-copy form `seq[:]`
  is supported.

Dictionaries (Mappings)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMite supports Dictionaries having up to 32767 key, value pairs.
Dictionary keys must be of a hashable type.  A TypeError will occur if you try
set a value using a non-hashable key.
Values can be of any type.

Operator Precedence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMite keeps the same operator precedence as Python.

=========================== ================================================
Operator                    Comment
=========================== ================================================
, [...] {...}               Tuple, List & Dict. creation.
s[i] s[:] s.attr f(...)     Index & copy; attributes, function calls
+x, -x, ~x                  Unary operators
x**y                        Power
x*y x/y x%y                 Mult, division, modulo
x+y x-y                     Addition, subtraction
x<<y   x>>y                 Bit shifting
x&y                         Bitwise and
x^y                         Bitwise exclusive or
x|y                         Bitwise or
x<y  x<=y  x>y  x>=y        Comparison
x==y x!=y                   Comparison
x is y   x is not y         Identity
x in s   x not in s  ,      Membership
not x                       Boolean negation
x and y                     Boolean and
x or y                      Boolean or
=========================== ================================================

PyMite DOES NOT support overriding type operators using the special forms of
identifiers.  For example, ``__add__()`` WILL NOT implement or override
the ``+`` operator.


Basic Types and Their Operations
--------------------------------

Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~

=========== ================================================================
Comparison  Meaning
=========== ================================================================
**<**       Strictly less than
**<=**      Less than or equal to
**>**       Strictly greater than
**>=**      Greater than or equal to
**==**      Equal to
**!=**      Not equal to
**is**      Object identity
**is not**  Negated object identity
=========== ================================================================

None
~~~~

``None`` is used as default return value on functions.  Built-in single object.
``None`` is a constant; trying to bind a value to the name ``None`` is now a
syntax error.

Boolean Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

=================== ========================================================
Val or Op           Evaluates to
=================== ========================================================
``None``, zero      Considered false
Empty sequences     Considered false
Empty mappings      Considered false
All other values    Considered true
**not** x           True if x is false, else false
x **or** y          If x is false then y, else x
x **and** y         If x is false then x, else y
=================== ========================================================


Statements
----------

======================  ========================================================
Statement               Result
======================  ========================================================
``pass``                Null statement
``del`` `name`          Unbind name(s) from object
``print`` s1 [,s2]*     Writes to output defined in platform-specific code
======================  ========================================================

PyMite implementes all of Python's ``control flow`` statements
(``if/elif/else``, ``while/else``, ``for/in/else``, ``break, continue, return``)
with the exception of the ``yield`` statement.
PyMite DOES NOT implement exceptions(``try/except/else/finally``).
PyMite supports these forms of the ``import`` statement::

    import module
    import module as name
    from module import name
    from module import *

PyMite supports use of the ``global`` statement to declare a global variable.

PyMite supports the basic form of function definition::

    def funcname(arg1, arg2, ... ):
        funcbody

Support for arguments having default values is configurable (in pmfeatures.h)
and is enabled by default::

    def funcname(arg1, arg2="foo", arg3=42):
        funcbody


Built-in Functions
------------------

Built-in functions are defined in the module ``__bi`` which is automatically
imported.

=========== ====================================================================
Function    Result
=========== ====================================================================
abs(x)      The absolute value of the number `x`
chr(i)      Returns one-character string whose ASCII code is integer `i`.
eval(co)    Evaluates a given code object (created by Co()).
globals()   Returns a dictionary containing the current global variables.
id(o)       Returns a unique integer identifier for object, `o`.
len(obj)    Returns the length (the number of items) of a sequence or
            dictionary.
locals()    Returns a dictionary containing current local variables.
map(f,s)    Returns a list containing the output of function, `f`, applied to
            every item in sequence, `s`.
ord(c)      Returns integer ASCII value of `c` (a string of len 1).
pow(x,y)    Returns `x` to power `y`. See also ``**`` operator.
range(...)  Returns list of ints from >= start and < end.
            With 1 arg, list from 0..arg-1.
            With 2 args, list from start..end-1.
            With 3 args, list from start up to end by step.
sum(s)      Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers, `s` (not strings).
            Returns ``0`` when the sequence is empty.
type(obj)   Returns an integer representing the `type` of an object.
            See obj.h in PyMite for the value of each type.
=========== ====================================================================


Library Modules
---------------

PyMite DOES NOT offer any of the library modules from Python.  Instead, PyMite
offers its own set of library modules, some of which have the same name as
a module name from Python.

PyMite offers the following library modules::

    dict            func            list            string          sys


Idiom Hints
-----------

PyMite does NOT support the idiom ``if __name__ == "__main__":``,
instead this should be used: ``if ismain():``
where the ``ismain()`` function is part of the builtins module.

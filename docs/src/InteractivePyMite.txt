Interactive PyMite

Purpose
-------

This document describes the design, implementation and use of the interactive
session for PyMite.  In doing so, it serves as a design document for the PyMite
developer and a user manual for the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

Interactive PyMite (ipm) is a core feature of PyMite that allows the user to
type lines of source code on a host computer that is to be executed on a target
device.  Ipm provides rapid code experimentation much like `Python's
interactive mode`_.  Ipm is made from two pieces: the interactive
interface running on the host (ipm-host) and a program running on the target
that communicates with the host and executes the interactive code (ipm-target).

.. _`Python's interactive mode`: http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html#interactive-mode

Design of ipm-host
------------------

Ipm-host is the program that runs on a host computer (desktop or laptop)
and runs on 3 popular operating systems (Mac OS X, Linux and MS-Win32).
Ipm-host provides an interactive interface much like CPython's interactive
mode.  The user provides the desired method to connect to the target as
an option given to ipm-host.  Ipm-host connects to the target over the
designated connection method and communicates bi-directionally with the target.

Ipm-host prints a prompt and accept user input.  Three types of input are
accepted: source code to be executed on the target, commands that change
the operating environment, and commands to interrupt or quit the interactive
session.

When the user types source code, the code is compiled to a code image
using pmImgCreator.py found in src/tools.  The image is sent over the
connection to the target device.  Ipm-host reads all reply characters
from the connection until a designated termination byte is received.  Ipm-host
prints the reply to the host's screen and repeats the process.

Ipm-host commands are TBD.  One early estimate of a command is
``load <module>``.  Which compiles a module on the host to an image and
transfers the image to the target where it is stored in persistent memory.
Ipm-host commands should not use names that are Python keywords and ipm
users shall not be able to name variables that are names of ipm commands.

Ipm-host accepts two special control commands: Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D.
Ctrl+C interrupts ipm-host as it waits for a reply from the target
and causes ipm-host to ignore any response from the target.
Ctrl+D causes ipm-host to signal ipm-target to quit; and then ipm-host itself
quits.


Design of ipm-target
--------------------

Ipm-target is a program that runs in the PyMite VM on the target device
(embedded or desktop).  Ipm-target is implemented in the ``ipm`` module that
is part of PyMite's standard library.  The target device must be explicitly
programmed to initiate the ipm-target program.

Ipm-target waits indefinitely for input over the target's standard connection
(serial port).  Ipm-target expects a code image.  Ipm-target converts the code
image to a code object and then calls the built-in function ``eval()`` on that
code object.  Since the code image was compiled by ipm-host using the ``single``
argument to ``compile()``, the code image already contains the commands
necessary to print output.  After the code is executed ipm-target
sends the designated terminal byte to indicate that evaluation is
complete and that ipm-target is ready for the next image.


Using ipm-host
--------------

PyMite includes the Python program, ``src/tools/ipm.py``, that is a
cross-platform implementation of ipm-host that runs from a command prompt.


Runnin ipm on the Desktop
-------------------------

The sample project in ``src/platform/desktop/`` was created to build PyMite
for the desktop target. The output of this project is used by ipm-host when it
is commanded to connect using the "desktop" connection.  Perform the following
steps from the project root directory to build and run ipm on the desktop::

    make ipm

Ipm-host should launch and print its startup message followed by the ipm prompt.
Now you may type source code and see the results.  Type Ctrl+D (twice) when
you are done.  The following is a sample interactive session::

    ipm> print "timmy"
    timmy
    ipm> d={}
    ipm> d[0] = None
    ipm> d[1] = "one"
    ipm> d[2] = abs(-99)
    ipm> d[3] = len(range(5))
    ipm> d['hello'] = "world"
    ipm> t = (2,"tuple")
    ipm> d[t] = []
    ipm> print d
    {(2, 'tuple'):[], 'hello':'world', 3:5, 2:99, 1:'one', 0:None}
    ipm> [chr(x+0x30) for x in range(50) if x%4 == 3]
    ['3', '7', ';', '?', 'C', 'G', 'K', 'O', 'S', 'W', '[', '_']
    ipm> ^D


Running ipm on an embedded target
---------------------------------

The sample project in ``src/platform/mmb103`` demonstrates running ipm on an
Atmel ATmega103 microcontroller and connecting to its UART.  This project is
specific to hardware that is not publicly availble; so it cannot be used as is.
However, it serves as an example that can be copied.

To run ipm on the target, write your PyMite application so that it executes
these two lines.  The second line runs in a loop until an exception occurs that
causes the VM to exit::

    import ipm
    ipm.ipm()

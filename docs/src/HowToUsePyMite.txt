How to Use PyMite
=================

Purpose
-------

This document describes how to use the high-level PyMite API
to run a user module.  In doing so, it helps the developer
write system tests and the user write a PyMite application.

Overview
--------

PyMite shall provide a high-level API that makes it easy to use the
virtual machine (VM).  In most cases, one must write the application
in Python and a small ``main()`` in C that uses the high-level API.
After the sources are written, the Python application is converted
to an image using ``pmImgCreator`` and the image is compiled with the
user's C code and linked to the PyMite VM library, ``libpmvm.a``.
The build process is explained in greater detail in `BuildSystem`_.

PyMite Example
--------------

This section demonstrates how a trivial program is written to run
in the PyMite VM.  A more detailed example can be found in the PyMite
source tree in ``src/sample``.

First write the Python application, ``trivial.py`` that will run in the VM::

    def funcname(n):
        return n-42

    funcname(6*7)

Notice that an application in PyMite does not use the
``if __name__ == "__main__":`` convention that Python does;
also note that the program written above will run on a desktop Python VM.

The next step is to create a C file that will run this program in the PyMite VM.
The following C program will do exactly that::

    #include "pm.h"

    extern unsigned char usrlib_img[];

    int main(void)
    {
        PmReturn_t retval;

        retval = pm_init(MEMSPACE_PROG, usrlib_img);
        PM_RETURN_IF_ERROR(retval);

        retval = pm_run((uint8_t *)"trivial");
        return (int)retval;
    }

Since not all Python programmers are familiar with C, I will explain the program
above line by line.  The ``include`` statement brings many PyMite definitions
such as ``pm_init()``, ``pm_run()``, and ``MEMSPACE_PROG`` into the namespace
of this file.  The ``extern`` line tells the compiler that the variable
``usrlib_img[]`` is defined in another file.  Next the ``main()`` function
means this program will run as the primary executable on the target.

Inside ``main()`` the ``retval`` variable is declared.  It is used to catch
any error codes that might come from the PyMite API functions.
Next, the call to ``pm_init()`` initializes the VM and tells it where to find
the images of the user application.  In our case, the ``trivial.py`` Python
program was turned into ``trivial_img.c`` and ``trivial_nat.c``
by the tool ``pmImgCreator``.
Inside ``trivial_img.c`` is where one finds the variable ``usrlib_img[]``
which contains the `image` of our application (the equivalent of a ``.pyc``
file).  Our application does not have any native code, but ``trivial_nat.c``
is still needed because it defines an empty function table that needs to be
linked to the VM.  The macro ``PM_RETURN_IF_ERROR()`` does what its name
suggests.

The next PyMite API, ``pm_run()`` tries to execute the module with the same
name as the string you give to the function.  Here we tell the VM to find
the module ``trivial`` in the global list of modules and run it.
Behind the scenes, the module is loaded from its image into a structure in RAM
and bytecodes are executed until program completion or an unhandled exception
occurs.

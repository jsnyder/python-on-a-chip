Pyton-on-a-Chip Overview

Purpose
-------

This document gives an overview of Python-on-a-Chip, the software and
the project that develops it.  In doing so, it helps the newcomer understand
the scope of the project and intended purpose of the software.


Introduction
------------

Python-on-a-Chip (p14p) is a project to develop a reduced Python virtual machine
(codenamed PyMite) that runs a significant subset of the Python language on
microcontrollers without an OS. The other parts of p14p are the device drivers,
high-level libraries and other tools.

The flyweight PyMite VM was written from scratch to execute on
8-bit and larger microcontrollers with resources as limited as 64 KiB of
program memory (flash) and 4 KiB of RAM.  PyMite supports a subset of the
Python syntax and can execute a subset of its bytecodes.  The PyMite VM must
be linked to the rest of the p14p software to provide a working system.
P14p can be compiled, tested and executed on an embedded platform as well as
a desktop computer.

P14p is targeted toward microcontrollers with limited program memory and RAM.
In order to operate in this embedded environment, p14p has to sacrifice some
features found in desktop Python.  However, p14p's features list is impressive
and growing.


Intended Audience
-----------------

With Python's reputation for being friendly to beginning programmers, p14p
should appeal to those who are programming microcontrollers for the first time.
For those familiar with Python, p14p provides a rapid development environment.
And for those with Python and C or assembly experience, p14p's `Native Function`
interface provides a powerful way to embed low-level code in a Python function.
In short, p14p has something for all levels of programmers.

Python is a language that is easy to learn.  P14p is just as easy to learn,
if not more so because there is less to learn.  This should allow brand new
and novice programmers a straightforward path to writing code for a
microcontroller.  The entry-level programmer, though, will have to wait until
p14p is `ported` to the microcontroller that they are using.  By this, I mean,
that in order to use the pins and peripherals of a specific microcontroller,
a C or assembly code library must be written to interface p14p to that
microcontroller.

P14p supports the important datatypes an experienced Python programmer
expects: 32-bit signed integers, Strings, Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries
(a.k.a. Dicts, Hashes and Maps).  P14p also supports the basic flow
control statements and logic statements.  Even some of Python's more
advanced features such as generators, classes and decorators are supported.
See `PyMiteFeatures`_ for a detailed description of what p14p supports.
Suffice to say, p14p has enough to keep you busy.

P14p would not be complete without a way for the Python application code
to call low-level routines to access the special features of a microcontroller.
P14p provides this advanced feature called `Native Function` and has a
slick and easy way to implement them.  `Native Functions` are written by
defining a function in Python code with the keyword ``pass`` as the function's
body, but inserting C code in the function's documentation string.  Macros are
provided to access the VM stack and arguments to the function.  Within
the C code, the developer may write assembly code using the ``asm()`` statement
if desired.  The context switch overhead to call a ``Native Function`` is near
that of calling a function from within C.  This fast and convenient interface
between Python code and C code provides the advanced developer a means to access
the low-level features of the microcontroller and the VM itself.

The P14p Project
----------------

The P14p project is hosted at http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/
The latest release is available for download from that site.
The site also explains how to obtain the latest development version
of via the Subversion_ source code management tool.

P14p does not have a set schedule for releases.  The current system is
to make a release when a significant set of changes have been mainlined
and a fair set of tests has shown the changes to be working to some degree.
The determination of "significant" is up to the lead developer.

http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/ serves as the center for p14p
development.  P14p comes as a source distribution only.  The user should be
familiar with ``.tar.gz`` files and installing a cross-compile toolchain in
order to build p14p for a target platform.  P14p uses a `Makefile` system
and the GCC toolchain by default to build for the default desktop platform.

If p14p does not support your needs now, join the `P14p discussion list`_
to make your desire known and help make it happen.

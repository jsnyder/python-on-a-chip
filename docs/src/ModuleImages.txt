PyMite Module Images

Purpose
-------

This document describes the use of module images in the PyMite virtual machine
(VM).  In doing so, it serves as a design document for the PyMite
developer and, to some extent, a user manual for the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

In PyMite, a module image is created by the tool, `pmImgCreator`.  Two groups
of modules images are used by the VM, the PyMite standard library (`pmstdlib`)
and the user library (`usrlib`).  A group of module images is simply a
contiguous array of module images in a memory space with a null byte as a
terminator.  During initialization, the VM scans both groups of module
images to create a dict used to lookup modules throughout the life of the
VM's execution.

Creating Module Images
----------------------

The `pmImgCreator` tool takes as input command line options and file name
arguments.  The command line options determine the type of image output file
to create (C language array of bytes or raw binary), the file name to use for the
native functions (optional), the memory space that the images should be
placed in and whether the output image is to become the VM's standard library,
`pmstdlib`, or the user library, `usrlib`.

The `pmstdlib`
--------------

The PyMite build system creates `pmstdlib` from a defined set of module source
files found in ``src/lib/``.  The list of modules used to create `pmstdlib`
can be modified by changing the file list in ``src/lib/Makefile``.  The
standard VM build process uses `pmImgCreator` to generate the C files
``pmstdlib_img.c`` and ``pmstdlib_nat.c`` which are built into the VM
automatically during a typical build.  The `pmstdlib` images are always located
in program (Flash) memory.

The `usrlib`
------------

When building a PyMite application, the Python application source code files are
converted into a sequence images that can be located in any memory space:
program memory, RAM, EEPROM or even external memories such as serial EEPROMs.
The images must be contiguous and all in the same memory space.

The typical way to build an application is to generate ``usrlib_img.c`` and
``usrlib_nat.c`` using `pmImgCreator`, and link that with your application's
main C file and the PyMite library, ``libpmvm.a``.  Then, in the main C file,
the name of the module to execute is given to the VM via an obvious API call
(TBD).

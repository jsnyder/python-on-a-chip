PyMite VM Errors and Exceptions
===============================

:Author:    Dean Hall
:Id:        $Id$

Purpose
-------

This document describes the types of errors and exceptions that
can occur with the PyMite virtual machine (VM).
In doing so, it serves primarily as a design document for the PyMite
developer and, to a lesser extent, a user manual for the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

PyMite shall define the C data type ``PmReturn_t`` as the general type for
error codes that are returned from functions within the VM.  Since some
functions need to return an exception and do not have access to the VM's
stack, ``PmReturn_t`` is also capable of returning codes that indicate
when an exceptional situation has occured.  PyMite supports only a subset
of the exception types that `Python has`_.

When a function returns a code to the VM that indicates an exceptional
situation, the VM quits the normal interpreter loop and raises an exception.
If the application program has prepared to catch the exception, the VM will
do so; otherwise, an unhandled exception causes the interpreter loop to quit
and the ``PmReturn_t`` code is returned to the calling environment.

.. _`Python has`: http://docs.python.org/api/standardExceptions.html

Errors
------

The ``PmReturn_t`` data type is defined in ``src/vm/pm.h``.
It is an enumeration that needs to fit within eight bits,
which means there are only 256 values available for use.

Currently there are only a few values that are allocated for function return
status values.  The following table lists these values and their meanings:

    =================   =========   ========================================
    Name                Value       Meaning
    =================   =========   ========================================
    PM_RET_OK           0x00        Everything is okay
    PM_RET_NO           0xFF        General "no result"
    PM_RET_ERR          0xFE        General failure
    PM_RET_STUB         0xFD        Return value for stub function
    =================   =========   ========================================

Exceptions
----------

The other values of the ``PmReturn_t`` enumeration are used to indicate an
exceptional situation that will cause the VM to quit unless it is properly
handled.  The list of exceptions implemented is determined partly by necessity
and partly by an estimation of future necessity.  The following table lists
the return types that will lead to exceptions:

    =================   =========   ========================================
    Name                Value       Meaning
    =================   =========   ========================================
    PM_RET_EX           0xE0        General exception
    PM_RET_EX_EXIT      0xE1        System exit
    PM_RET_EX_IO        0xE2        Input/output error
    PM_RET_EX_ZDIV      0xE3        Zero division error
    PM_RET_EX_ASSRT     0xE4        Assertion error
    PM_RET_EX_ATTR      0xE5        Attribute error
    PM_RET_EX_IMPRT     0xE6        Import error
    PM_RET_EX_INDX      0xE7        Index error
    PM_RET_EX_KEY       0xE8        Key error
    PM_RET_EX_MEM       0xE9        Memory error
    PM_RET_EX_NAME      0xEA        Name error
    PM_RET_EX_RUNTIME   0xEB        Runtime error
    PM_RET_EX_SYNTAX    0xEB        Syntax error
    PM_RET_EX_SYS       0xEc        System error
    PM_RET_EX_TYPE      0xED        Type error
    PM_RET_EX_VAL       0xEE        Value error
    PM_RET_EX_STOP      0xEF        Stop iteration
    PM_RET_EX_WARN      0xF0        Warning
    =================   =========   ========================================

In PyMite, there is only one kind of exception object and the PyMite user
should not try to subclass it.  Instead, the user should create an instance
of Exception and set the ``code`` attribute to a value that is unique among
all other exceptions.  For built-in exception types, the ``code`` field has
a value that is identical to the ``PmReturn_t`` value with the same meaning.

For example the built-in ``AssertionError`` is created like this in the
builtins module::

    AssertionError = _exn()
    AssertionError.code = 0xE4

User exceptions are usually written in Python application code, but can be
created in a PyMite native function.  The following is an example of how to
create a user exception::

    SerialError = _exn()
    SerialError.code = 0xC0

That's all there is to it.  Just be sure that the ``code`` is completely unique
from all other kinds of exceptions, both system and user exceptions.

====================
The Assert Statement
====================

:Author:    Dean Hall
:Id:        $Id$

Purpose
-------

This document describes the implementation and use of the assert statement
in the PyMite virtual machine (VM).  In doing so, it serves as a design
document for the PyMite developer and a user manual for the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

PyMite shall support the simple form of `assert statements`_ and may support
the extended form.  The assert statement is useful in unit tests for the
PyMite VM itself and is thus worth implementing.  The assert statement
inherently depends on having exceptions available.  When an assertion fails,
an ``AssertionError`` exception is raised.  To read about exceptions in
PyMite, see `ErrorsAndExceptions`_.

.. _`ErrorsAndExceptions`: TBD


Background
----------

A simple example assert statement looks like this::

    assert arg != None

The above line of code compiles to the following bytecode::

    >>> co = compile("assert arg != None","fn","single")
    >>> dis.disco(co)
      1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (arg)
                  3 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
                  6 COMPARE_OP               3 (!=)
                  9 JUMP_IF_TRUE             7 (to 19)
                 12 POP_TOP
                 13 LOAD_GLOBAL              2 (AssertionError)
                 16 RAISE_VARARGS            1
            >>   19 POP_TOP
                 20 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
                 23 RETURN_VALUE

All of the bytecodes listed above exist in PyMite release 02 except for
``RAISE_VARARGS``.  The ``RAISE_VARARGS`` bytecode is described `here`_
in these words::

    RAISE_VARARGS    argc
        Raises an exception. argc indicates the number of parameters to the
        raise statement, ranging from 0 to 3. The handler will find the
        traceback as TOS2, the parameter as TOS1, and the exception as TOS.

Implementation
--------------

To support the ``assert`` statement a built-in named ``AssertionError`` must
exist and the ``RAISE_VARARGS`` (1) bytecode must be implemented.  To create
``AssertionError``, a native function, ``_exn()``, will be created in
``__bi.py`` that allocates an exception object (OBJ_TYPE_EXN).  The
``AssertionError`` object will also have an integer attribute, ``code``, that
corresponds to the value of the PmReturn_t code that represents that exception.
In this case, ``PM_RET_EX_ASSRT``.  So, the code added to ``__bi.py`` will
look like this::

    AssertionError = _exn()
    AssertionError.code = 0xE4

The first step to support ``RAISE_VARARGS`` is to make ``pmImgCreator.py``
aware that this bytecode is supported.  Then, the bytecode implementation shall
do the following:

    - pop the top of the stack and expect an exception object (OBJ_TYPE_EXN).
    - push the None object as the traceback
    - push the None object as the parameter (???)
    - push the exception object

The above steps will get the stack ready for any exception handling if it is
present.  The "try/except" structure that would setup exception handling
is not yet supported in PyMite, but it may be in the future.

Finally, tests shall be written to exercise the ``assert`` statement.
Full testing would require "try/except" support to catch expected exceptions,
so that shall have to wait.

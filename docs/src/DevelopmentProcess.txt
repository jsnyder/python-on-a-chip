PyMite Development Process
==========================

:Author:    Dean Hall
:Id:        $Id$


Purpose
-------

This document describes the process used to make changes to the PyMite
project.  In doing so, it serves as a how-to manual for the PyMite
developer and can be ignored by the PyMite user.

This document is incomplete and subject to change.  Please suggest improvements.


Overview
--------

Software quality is enhanced when the project developers consistently
employ a defined software process.  The process should enhance the development
of the software and not burden it.  This process takes ideas from popular
standard processes, with specific attention to `Divmod's process`_, UQDS.
If this document does not explain your question, refer to UQDS for the answer.
Since long process documents often go unread, this document should be as
concise as possible.

.. _`Divmod's Process`: http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/UltimateQualityDevelopmentSystem

Here is a brief description of the process:

    1. All changes must be documented, so create a ticket in Trac.
    2. Do the work and provide a change-set for review.
    3. Apply feedback from review, run tests and mainline.


Creating a Ticket
-----------------

Submit all enhancements, defects, issues and tickets to the 
`Python-on-a-chip Google Code`_ site.  Or go straight to `create a new ticket`_.

.. _`Python-on-a-chip Google Code`: http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip
.. _`create a new ticket`: http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/issues/entry

The following table explains what to enter in the fields when creating a ticket:

=========== =================================== ================================
Field       What to enter                       Example
=========== =================================== ================================
Summary     Short sentence starting with verb   Enable compiler warnings as
            that explains the issue             errors
Description A longer explanation of the problem
            possibly with example code that
            exercises or exposes the issue.
Status      If you want it, leave it as         Accepted
            Accepted.  Otherwise clear the box.
Owner       If you want it, take it.  Otherwise dwhall256
            leave it blank.
Labels      Select the proper label-type from   Type-Defect
            the three that are given: Type,     Priority-Medium
            Priority and Component.             Component-pmvm
=========== =================================== ================================

The `Summary` field is often copied into the release notes' change log, with
the opening verb changed to the past tense.  Conceive your `Summary` from that
point of view.  The `Milestone-` label is used by the project manager to know
what issues should be resolved for what releases.  Leave out the `Milestone` 
label unless you've been told to do otherwise.  Select the most appropriate
component from the `Component-` list.  Even if the resolution touches more
than one component, select the one that applies best.


Doing the Work
--------------

If the work involved is a defect, the first step is to create the smallest
test possible that exposes the defect.  This regression test should be put
into the project's automated test system ``src/test/system/``.

If the work involved is an enhancement or a defect that requires a significant
change, a document should be created which explains the architecture or design
of the work.  This document should be composed in `reStructuredText`_ and
put into the project's automated documentation build system ``docs/src/``.

If the work only involves a small change, or a similar small change across
many files, then the work can be done on a working copy of the project
``trunk/`` and the code review can be performed by attaching the output of
``svn diff`` to the ticket.

If there are more than a few changes, make a branch to work in::

    svn cp https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ \
           https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/branches/issue_0NNN_userid_brief_description \
           -m "issue #NNN: creating branch for work"

If you've already made changes to a working copy that isn't the new branch,
it's easy to switch to the new branch and keep your changes::

    svn switch https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/branches/issue_0NNN_userid_brief_description

During this phase, if the trunk is updated, you should merge those changes into
your branch so that your working copy is always up-to-date.  Doing this
merge-forward step avoids the problem of when you mainline your branch and your
changes don't work with the modified trunk.  Use the following command to
merge-forward changes from the trunk::

    svn update

Pay attention to the output of this command to see if there are conflicts that
must be resolved.

.. WARNING:: the `mainlining step`_ described below will merge improperly
             if you do not keep your branch up-to-date using the merge-forward
             process.

.. _`reStructuredText`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _`mainlining step`: Mainlining_


Testing
-------

The project has an automated test system that is run by typing ``make check``.
These tests must pass before a ticket can be mainlined,
but passing these tests doesn't automatically mean a ticket is mainlined.
If the work done impacted any of the project source code, then testing should
also be performed on all targets, desktop and device.  If the ticket described
a defect, then you should have already made a test to put in the automated
test system, so that test will already be in the set run by ``make check``.


Reviewing
---------

After the developer does the work and runs the tests, he checks in the branch.
When the developer goes to post the differences for review,
the differences should be from the head of the branch to the head of the
trunk.  It is a common mistake to take the difference from the head of the
branch to the origin of the branch.  This is a mistake because the trunk
may have progressed since then and the developer should have merged-forward
throughout the lifetime of the branch.  Diffing to the head of the trunk shows
that the developer kept up-to-date with the current code and gives the proper
change-set to merge the branch into the trunk.  The following command line will
create a diff between the head of the branch and the head of the trunk::

    svn diff . https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Reviewers give feedback to the developer, possibly in the form of a patch file--
if the volume of feedback is large--that would be applied to the head of the
branch.

The developer applies all the feedback and re-tests the branch.


Mainlining
----------

Mainlining happens after the change-set is reviewed and the feedback is
integrated and the tests pass.  Mainlining is the process of applying the
branch to the trunk.  This is one of the few not-so-intuitive processes of
Subversion.  Start by ensuring your branch has merged-forward all changes
to the trunk since the branch was created::

    svn up

Switch the working copy of the branch to the project trunk::

    svn switch https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Merge the differences between trunk and the branch into your working copy::

    svn merge https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ \
        https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/branches/issue_0NNN_userid_brief_description .

Inspect and test the working copy, then commit it to the trunk::

    svn ci -m "issue #NNN: mainlining branch issue_0NNN_userid_brief_description"

Finally, update the ticket to set the `Status` to Fixed.

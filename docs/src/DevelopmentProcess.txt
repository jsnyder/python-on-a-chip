PyMite Development Process
==========================

:Author:    Dean Hall

Purpose
-------

This document describes the process used to make changes to files in the
Python-on-a-Chip project.  In doing so, it serves as a how-to manual for the
developer and can be ignored by the user.

This document is incomplete and subject to change.  Please suggest improvements.


Overview
--------

Software quality is enhanced when the project developers consistently
employ a defined software process.  The process should enhance the development
of the software and not burden it.  This process is a typical branch-based
development process that uses Subversion_ and `Google Code`_.
If this document does not explain your question, please ask on the maillist_.
Since long process documents often go unread, this document is as concise as 
possible.

.. _Subversion: http://subversion.apache.org/
.. _`Google Code`: http://code.google.com/
.. _maillist: http://groups.google.com/group/python-on-a-chip

Here is a brief description of the process:

    #. `Create an Issue`_
    #. `Do the Work`_
    #. `Link Commits and Messages`_
    #. `Keep in Sync with Trunk`_
    #. `Run tests`_
    #. `Post for Review`_
    #. `Merge to trunk`_


Create an Issue
---------------

`Create a new issue`_ to capture and document enhancments and defects.

.. _`Create a new issue`: http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/issues/entry

The following table explains what to enter in the fields when creating an issue:

=========== =================================== ================================
Field       What to enter                       Example
=========== =================================== ================================
Summary     Short sentence *starting with verb* Enable compiler warnings as
            that explains the issue             errors
Description A longer explanation of the problem
            possibly with example code that
            exercises or exposes the issue.
Status      If you want it, leave it as         Accepted
            Accepted.  Otherwise clear the box.
Owner       If you want it, take it.  Otherwise dwhall256
            leave it blank.
Labels      Select the proper label-type from   Type-Defect
            the three that are given: Type,     Priority-Medium
            Priority and Component.             Component-pmvm
=========== =================================== ================================

The `Summary` field is often copied into the release notes' change log, with
the opening verb changed to the past tense.  Conceive your `Summary` from that
point of view.  The `Milestone-` label is used by the project manager to know
what issues should be resolved for what releases.  Leave out the `Milestone`
label unless you've been told to do otherwise.  Select the most appropriate
component from the `Component-` list.  Even if the resolution touches more
than one component, select the one that applies best.


Do the Work
-----------

The developer must first obtain a local copy of the code.
If the work only involves a small change, or a similar small change across
many files, then the work can be done on a working copy of ``trunk/``::

    svn co https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ --userid YourUserId

If there are more than a few changes, make a branch to work in and check
out a local copy::

    svn cp https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ \
           https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/branches/issue_0NNN_userid_brief_description \
           -m "Issue #NNN: creating branch for work"
    svn co https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/branches/issue_0NNN_userid_brief_description --userid YourUserId

If the work involved is a defect, the developer should create the smallest
test possible that exposes the defect.  This regression test should be added
to the project's automated test system::

    svn add src/test/system/tNNN.c src/test/system/tNNN.py

If the work required a significant architectural change,
a document should be created which explains the design of the work.
This document should be composed in `reStructuredText`_ and
added to the project's automated documentation build system ``docs/src/``::

    svn add docs/src/NewDocumentTitle.txt


.. _`reStructuredText`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html


Link Commits and Messages
-------------------------

Every time the developer commits code to either trunk or his branch,
he should add a commit message such as the following which lets Google Code
hyperlink the commit to the issue::

    svn ci -m "Issue #NNN: checking in on branch"

or::

    svn ci -m "Issue #NNN: mainlining directly"

Then, the developer should describe the changes in a new comment in the issue.
The developer should prefix this comment with the revision number
that resulted from the commit action, like so::

    rYYY: Fixed a null pointer in src/vm/interp.c

Where ``YYY`` is the number of the revision that resulted from the check-in.
These two little text snippets create a precise two-way linkage between the
physical changes to the code and the aggregated notes of an issue,
resulting in a documented process that is easy for others to follow.


Keep in Sync with Trunk
-----------------------

While doing the work, if the trunk is updated, you should merge those changes
into your branch so that your working copy is always up-to-date.  Doing this
merge-forward step avoids the problem of when you mainline your branch and your
changes don't work with the modified trunk.  If you are working on a local
copy of trunk/, then staying synced is easy: just use the command::

    svn update

Pay attention to the output of this command to see if there are conflicts that
must be resolved.

If you are working on a branch, there are two ways to stay in sync with trunk/.
Merging trunk to your local copy and then commiting your branch is recommended::

    svn merge http://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ .
    svn ci -m "Issue #NN merging trunk to branch"


Run Tests
---------

The project has an automated test system that is run by typing the following
from the root of the project::

    make check

These tests must pass before an issue may be mainlined, but passing
these tests is not the only qualification for mainlining.
If the work done impacted any of the project source code, then testing should
also be performed on the relevant desktop and target platforms.  If the issue
describes a defect, then you should already have a test in the automated test
system, so that test will be run by ``make check``.


Post for Review
---------------

.. NOTE:: The Google Code review process should NOT be used.

After the developer does the work, syncs to the trunk and runs the tests,
he posts the changes for review.  If the changes were few and the developer
made the changes on a local copy of trunk, then he should create a patch file
like so::

    svn diff > issueNNN.patch

He should send an email to the `p14p developer mailling list`_ and attach
the patch file.

If the changes were many and the developer worked on a branch, then
the developer must ensure that every commit he made is mentioned, via the
rYYY syntax, in the issue.  This way, the developer can simply send the URL
of his issue to the maillist for review::

    http://code.google.com/p/python-on-a-chip/issues/detail?id=NNN

Reviewers give polite and professional feedback to the developer within
48 hours or provide an estimate of how much longer it will take to review
the changes.

The developer applies all the feedback and re-tests the branch.

.. _`p14p developer mailling list`: http://groups.google.com/group/python-on-a-chip


Merge to Trunk
--------------

Merging to ``trunk/`` happens after the change-set is reviewed, feedback is
integrated and the tests pass.  Ensure the branch is in sync with trunk,
per the section above.  Then revert to a clean copy of trunk::

    svn switch https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Merge your branch into the working copy of trunk::

    svn merge https://python-on-a-chip.googlecode.com/svn/branches/issue_0NNN_userid_brief_description .

Build, test and verify the modified working copy, then commit it to the trunk::

    svn ci -m "Issue #NNN: mainlining branch issue_0NNN_userid_brief_description"

Add a comment to the issue::

    rYYY: merged branch to trunk

and set the ``Status`` field to Fixed.

Finally, announce that the issue is fixed on the mailling list.

===================
PyMite Self Testing
===================

:Author:    Dean Hall

Purpose
-------

This document describes PyMite's self tests.  In doing so, it serves as an
informational  document for the PyMite developer and is of little use to
the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

PyMite has two types of self tests: unit tests and system tests found in
``src/tests/unit/`` and ``src/tests/system/``, respectively.  `Unit tests`_
are meant to validate that a particular module of source code is working
properly.  `System tests`_, on the other hand, are conducted on a complete,
integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance to its design and
to expose any regressions to previous defects.

Unit Tests
----------

Three unit test frameworks were evaluated for use in the PyMite project:
`MinUnit`_, `CuTest`_ and `Check`_.  MinUnit is exactly what it says, a minimal
unit testing framework for C.  However, it does not provide a mechanism for
grouping tests into suites or reporting failures in a useful fashion.

.. _`MinUnit`: http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html
.. _`CuTest`: http://cutest.sourceforge.net/
.. _`Check`: http://sourceforge.net/projects/check/

The Check framework is at the other end of the spectrum.  It provides a
complete set of assert statements and a robust reporting system.  The down
sides of Check are that it is a somewhat large package to try to include in
PyMite.

The CuTest framework is just right.  It is one .c file and one .h file.
It has a handful of useful assert statements and reporting on stdout.
The CuTest license allows direct inclusion of CuTest source in any project.
CuTest is a quick learn if you are familiar with unit testing.

An appropriate set of unit tests shall be created using the chosen framework
and shall be compiled and run by the ``make check`` command.  The test harness
shall be written in such a way that if an error occurs or a test fails, the
``make check`` command exits with an error code.  Since ``make check`` is part
of the standard PyMite build process for mainlining, an error in unit tests
is considered a build break and will serve to notify the programmer that the
code is not in a valid state for mainlining.

The wording "an appropriate set of unit tests" is intentionally ambiguous.
The author knows no good way to calculate an optimal amount of tests,
so the amount shall be determined by good judgment.
One suggestion for a baseline amount of tests is that every built in object
type-- Int, List, Dict, etc.--should have tests for the most common uses of
each of its methods.

Unit tests can also be written for the Test First Coding practice if the
developer follows that practice.


System Tests
------------

A System Test is a full PyMite program: an application image including bytecode
that is executed by the ``interp()`` function.  It is the application code
that may be performing a test, exercising a portion of the VM or just
executing random bytecodes in an attempt to expose an error.

System tests are good tests to create when adding a new feature to PyMite.
The test serves as proof-of-concept code and its defect-free pass through
the test harness proves feature completion.

Unit tests can also be written for the Test First Coding practice if the
developer follows that practice.


Conclusion
----------

PyMite has two types of tests, Unit Tests and System Tests, that must run
without error or failures as part of the development process.  It is also
strongly suggested to create one test of either type as a part of fixing
an issue.  Unit tests are for very precise, small-scale issues.  System tests
are for broad, general issues.  Since both test types have automated harnesses,
testing is quick and easy and should be performed often.

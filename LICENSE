The Python-on-a-Chip program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

The author offers the PyMite VM under two separate licenses: open source
and commercial.  The PyMite VM is offered under the
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.  See src/vm/COPYING for details.
For commercial licensing terms, please contact the author directly.

The files in the directory docs/ constitute "the documentation."
The documentation is copyrighted by the individual author(s) of the file.
All documentation is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.
See docs/COPYING for details.

See src/lib/COPYING for details.


Effective Licensing
-------------------

The cumulitive effect of the licensing above results in two intended scenarios:

1. The licensee may use Python-on-a-Chip (including the PyMite VM) free of
   charge according to the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.
   This means that the licensee must offer his or her software that links with
   Python-on-a-Chip under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2 as well
   and make said software available for public download.

2. The licensee may purchase a commercial license for the PyMite VM by
   negotiating the license with Dean Hall (dwhall256@yahoo.com).  The terms
   of the negotiated commercial license allow the licensee's software that is
   linked to the PyMite VM to remain private if so desired.

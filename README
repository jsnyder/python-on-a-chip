Purpose
-------

The Python-on-a-Chip program consists of the PyMite virtual machine,
ports to specific platforms, libraries, tests, tools and documentation.
PyMite is a flyweight Python bytecode interpreter written from scratch
to execute in low memory on microcontrollers without an operating system.
PyMite supports a subset of Python 2.5 and can also be compiled, tested
and executed on a desktop computer.

for each component of the Python-on-a-Chip program.

The Python-on-a-Chip program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

Build
-----

You must build PyMite on a system with a POSIX-like terminal:
Mac OS X, Linux or Cygwin.  GNU Make should be installed.
The development system should have installed the
`GNU Compiler Collection`_ version 3.4 or later and `Python`_ 2.5 or 2.6.
The SCons build system is experimental.
Please read ``docs/src/BuildSystem.txt`` for more details.

To build PyMite for the desktop platform and run the interactive prompt
(press Control+D when done)::

    $ make ipm
    ...
    ipm> print "Hello world."
    Hello world.
    ipm> ^D

To run the system tests on the desktop::

    $ make check

To cross-compile for a different platform, type ``make PLATFORM=<plat>``
where ``<plat>`` is the name of a subdirectory in ``src/platform/``.
For example::

    $ make PLATFORM=avr

The author uses avr-gcc to compile for Atmel AVR microcontrollers
and arm-elf-gcc to compile for ARM7TDMI microcontrollers.

Since PyMite is so deeply embedded, it does not rely on many libraries.
When compiling for the AVR, it will need avr-libc.
